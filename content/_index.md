        Sadly most of these contain no links to source code or report as to prevent plagarism for future students, but you can find parts of them on my GitHub.

        - NVMe userspace FTL (GC) and log-structured NVMe file system for RocksDB
        - An SMT solver using DPLL(T) and a VCGen based on Hoare logic with the weakest precondition approach.
        - A simple to-do list application with persistent storage (psql) deployed on GCP using K8s, secured with TLS via cert-manager and RBAC. 
        - RISC-V Implementations of KATAN32 and RECTANGLE Ciphers, and a Verilog Implementation of the PRESENT Cipher with Masked S-Box.
