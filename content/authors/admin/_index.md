    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me
Hi there! I'm a second-year Computer Science Master's student at VU. My track focuses on computer systems and infrastructure. I'm currently supervised by Prof. Andres Goens (https://goens.org/) on topics related to AQL and the Compound Memory Model (https://goens.org/publications/goens-pldi-23/).

Previously, I worked at CARIAD as a cybersecurity engineer internship student under the supervision of Dr. Ilya Orerov (https://www.crypto.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/staff/ozerov.html.en), where I developed a TLS-PSK MITM attack script. You can find my script [here].

I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Qingdao University of Science and Technology, where I made some of the best friends of my life.

I'm generally interested in storage systems, heterogeneous multicore systems, formal verification, and HW/SW co-design.
